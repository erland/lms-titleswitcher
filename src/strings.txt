	EN	Define your custom formats, the name should be a single word, the value is a comma separated string with the formats that a custom format should consist of. For example: <br>ALBUM,ARTIST&nbsp;&nbsp(Switch between album and artist)<br>ALBUM:10,ARTIST:5&nbsp;&nbsp(Switch between album (10 sec) and artist (5 sec))<br>ARTIST,COMPOSER:5&nbsp;&nbsp(Switch between artist (default time) and composer (5 sec))<br><br>Specify the name of the custom format in the left column and the value in the right. When used in MusicInfoSCR the format will be prefixed with TITLESWITCHER, so a format named ALBUMARTIST here should be used as TITLESWITCHERALBUMARTIST in MusicInfoSCR settings.
